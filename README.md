Notes:

1.
Fonts:
Proxima Nova Soft
https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-soft/
It is not free font, and it is not very cheap. I found free versions, but I haven't got licience for using it in comersial.
I downloaded it - just to make task pixel perfect look like.
If you don't want to buy it, it's better to use a free looklike fonts.
